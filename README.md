1-Django Sessions for Enhanced User Experience:
Explanation: Utilizing Django sessions allows for the storage and retrieval of user-specific information across requests, enhancing the overall user experience. This is particularly useful for persisting authentication details and maintaining state information.

2-Celery and RabbitMQ for Asynchronous Email Processing:
Explanation: Celery is a distributed task queue system, and RabbitMQ is a message broker. Integrating these technologies allows you to perform tasks asynchronously, such as sending emails. This enhances the performance and responsiveness of the application by offloading time-consuming tasks to background processes.

3-Integrated Stripe Payment Gateway for Secure Transactions:
Explanation: Stripe is a popular payment gateway that provides a secure and seamless way to handle online transactions. Integrating Stripe into your application allows users to make secure payments using various payment methods.

4-Developed Webhook Endpoint to Handle Stripe Events:
Explanation: A webhook is an HTTP callback that allows external services, in this case, Stripe, to notify your application about specific events. By developing a webhook endpoint, your application can respond to events triggered by Stripe, such as successful payments or subscription changes, in real-time.

5-Managed Order Status, Marking Orders as Paid or Pending Payment:
Explanation: This involves implementing a system to manage the status of orders. Marking orders as paid or pending payment helps in tracking the progress of transactions. This information is crucial for both users and administrators to monitor the state of orders.
These features collectively contribute to creating a secure, efficient, and user-friendly e-commerce application. They address key aspects such as user authentication, asynchronous task processing, secure payment handling, real-time event handling, and effective order management. Each of these components is essential for providing a seamless and reliable e-commerce experience to users.
